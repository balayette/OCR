Made For The S3 Project in EPITA. October 2017
This software car recognize text in images.

Utilization:
    If needs be, create training data :
       $ make generate
       $ ./generate FONTS_PATH OUTPUT_PATH
       FONTS_PATH is the path to a directory that contains .ttf fonts ONLY.
       OUTPUT_PATH is the path to the output directory

    Build the other components :
       $ make all
       or
       $ make opti

       $ ./build/neuralnet DATA_PATH REPS (SAVE)
       DATA_PATH is the path to the training data
       REPS is the number of propagations to compute
       SAVE is optional, if specified the neural net will load the save instead
       of starting from scratch
       The trained neural net is saved to save.nn

       $ ./build/all SAVE IMAGE
       SAVE is the path to a neural net save file
       IMAGE is the path to the input image
       The output of the OCR is stored in output.txt

       $ make clean
